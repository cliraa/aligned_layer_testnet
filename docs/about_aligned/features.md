# Features

## Expanding capacities

With Aligned Layer, we are expanding Ethereum's ZK capabilities to include an interesting variety of proof systems in the Ethereum ecosystem. We want to offer the infrastructure for the future of trustless applications using verifiable computation and Ethereum's security.

## Neutrality

We are not in favor of any specific type of SNARK, and we support anyone involved in zero-knowledge technology development or research. Our focus is on supporting the development and research community involved in various proof systems.

## Innovation

We are helping foster open innovation in Ethereum by avoiding the constraints of the EVM, which enables us to introduce a new infrastructure to accelerate the roadmap for Ethereum and facilitate the integration of new technologies without modifying the underlying base protocol.
