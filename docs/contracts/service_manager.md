## AlignedLayerServiceManager: 
 
The constructor of the [contract](https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/blob/main/contracts/src/AlignedLayerServiceManager.sol) initializes the [alignedLayerTaskManager variable](https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/blob/main/contracts/src/AlignedLayerServiceManager.sol#L32) with the provided `IBLSRegistryCoordinatorWithIndices`, `ISlasher`, and `IAlignedLayerTaskManager` instances.

In this contract, the [freezeOperator function](https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/blob/main/contracts/src/AlignedLayerServiceManager.sol#L38) is defined, which is called during challenge resolution to freeze an operator's activities. However, the actual logic to freeze the operator is commented out in the function for now, as it mentions that the Slasher contract is still under development.
